###### Make sure to have the latest version of node and npm installed otherwise you will get errors.

1) Install dependencies and tasks
``` bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

2) Run on live refresh
``` bash
npm run watch
```

3) Optional: 
###### Personalized scss file
The sass method allows you to compile Sass into CSS. You may use the method like so:
```
mix.sass('resources/assets/sass/app.scss', 'public/css');
```
or 
```
mix.sass('resources/assets/sass/app.sass', 'public/css')
   .sass('resources/assets/sass/admin.sass', 'public/css/admin');
```

###### URL Processing
Because Laravel Mix is built on top of Webpack, it's important to understand a few Webpack concepts. For CSS compilation, Webpack will rewrite and optimize any url() calls within your stylesheets. While this might initially sound strange, it's an incredibly powerful piece of functionality. Imagine that we want to compile Sass that includes a relative URL to an image:
```
.example {
    background: url('../images/example.png');
}
```

###### Source Maps
Though disabled by default, source maps may be activated by calling the mix.sourceMaps() method in your webpack.mix.js file. Though it comes with a compile/performance cost, this will provide extra debugging information to your browser's developer tools when using compiled assets.
```
mix.js('resources/assets/js/app.js', 'public/js')
   .sourceMaps();
```

###### Vanilla JS
Similar to combining stylesheets with mix.styles(), you may also combine and minify any number of JavaScript files with the scripts() method:
```
mix.scripts([
    'public/js/admin.js',
    'public/js/dashboard.js'
], 'public/js/all.js');
```

###### Vendor Extraction
One potential downside to bundling all application-specific JavaScript with your vendor libraries is that it makes long-term caching more difficult. For example, a single update to your application code will force the browser to re-download all of your vendor libraries even if they haven't changed.

If you intend to make frequent updates to your application's JavaScript, you should consider extracting all of your vendor libraries into their own file. This way, a change to your application code will not affect the caching of your large vendor.js file. Mix's extract method makes this a breeze:
```
mix.js('resources/assets/js/app.js', 'public/js')
   .extract(['vue'])
```
The extract method accepts an array of all libraries or modules that you wish to extract into a  vendor.js file. Using the above snippet as an example, Mix will generate the following files:

public/js/manifest.js: The Webpack manifest runtime
public/js/vendor.js: Your vendor libraries
public/js/app.js: Your application code
To avoid JavaScript errors, be sure to load these files in the proper order:
```
<script src="/js/manifest.js"></script>
<script src="/js/vendor.js"></script>
<script src="/js/app.js"></script>
```

## Errors
Laravel 5.4 made a change to the default database character set, and itâ€™s now utf8mb4 which includes support for storing emojis. This only affects new applications and as long as you are running MySQL v5.7.7 and higher you do not need to do anything.

For those running MariaDB or older versions of MySQL you may hit this error when trying to run migrations:
```
[Illuminate\Database\QueryException]
SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes (SQL: alter table users add unique users_email_unique(email))

[PDOException]
SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes
```

As outlined in the Migrations [guide](https://laravel.com/docs/master/migrations#creating-indexes) to fix this all you have to do is edit your AppServiceProvider.php file and inside the boot method set a default string length:
```
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

public function boot()
{
    Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
}
```

After that everything should work as normal. If you enjoyed this post be sure and join the weekly [Laravel newsletter](https://laravel-news.com/newsletter) and never miss out on new releases, framework tips, and new tutorials.
